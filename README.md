# Firebase SDK Type Error: Unexpected Data Type

This repository contains a bug report and solution for a type error thrown by the Firebase SDK when retrieving data from the database. The error occurs when the data retrieved is not in the expected format. The solution involves adding type checking to ensure that the data retrieved is in the expected format.

## Bug

The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data retrieved from the database is not in the expected format. For example, if you are expecting a string but the database returns a number, the SDK might throw a type error. This can be difficult to debug because the error message may not be very informative.

## Solution

The solution involves adding type checking to ensure that data retrieved from the database is in the expected format. This can be done by using TypeScript or by adding explicit type checking to your JavaScript code.

## Example

**bug.js:**
```javascript
// Code that throws a type error
```

**bugSolution.js:**
```javascript
// Code that prevents the type error
```
